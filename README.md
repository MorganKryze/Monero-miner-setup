#### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MorganKryze/Monero-miner-setup.git
cd Monero-miner-setup
```

2. Install dependencies (platform-specific):

**macOS**:

```bash
make deps-macos
```

**Debian/Ubuntu**:

```bash
make deps-debian
```

3. Build XMRig:

```bash
make build
```

4. Create configuration:

Edit `templates/config.json.template` with your wallet address and mining preferences.

5. Set up as a service:

```bash
make service-setup
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Docker Usage

If you installed using Docker, use these commands:

```bash

# Start mining

cd docker && docker-compose up -d

# Stop mining

docker-compose down

# Check status and logs

docker-compose logs -f

# Update configuration

# Edit docker/.env, then restart:

docker-compose restart
```

### Native Installation Usage

If you used native installation, manage the mining service using these commands:

#### Service Management Commands

Start the mining service

```bash
make start
```

Stop the mining service

```bash
make stop
```

Restart the mining service

```bash
make restart
```

Check the service status

```bash
make status
```

#### Testing and Maintenance Commands

Run XMRig in the foreground (for testing)

```bash
make test
```

Disable and remove the mining service

```bash
make service-disable
```

Clean build files

```bash
make clean-build
```

Clean configuration files

```bash
make clean-configs
```

Complete wipe (build, configs, and service)

```bash
make wipe
```

Update XMRig and the repository (keeps your config)

```bash
make update
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The miner configuration is stored in two main files:

- `config.json` - Used for foreground testing
- `config_background.json` - Used by the service for background mining

### Key Configuration Options

- **CPU Threads**: Control how many CPU cores/threads to use (max-threads-hint)
- **Donation Level**: Set donation percentage to XMRig developers
- **Mining Pool**: Configure which pool to mine with
- **Worker Name**: Set custom name for your mining rig
- **Pause Settings**: Configure when mining should pause

To adjust these settings after installation, edit the files in the `configs/` directory.

## üîÑ Service Management

### Status Checking

The `make status` command shows:

- If the service is running
- Process IDs and resource usage
- Last lines of log files

### Service Persistence

The miner is configured as a system service:

- On macOS: Uses launchd
- On Linux: Uses systemd
- Service automatically starts after system reboots
- Service can recover from crashes

### Disabling the Service

To completely remove the service:

```bash
make service-disable
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Considerations

### Resource Usage

- Mining uses significant CPU resources by default (75% of cores)
- May cause system slowdowns during intensive operations
- Consider reducing thread usage (`-t` parameter) for better system responsiveness
- Monitor system temperatures to prevent overheating

### Platform Support

- macOS: Full support (tested on 14.7+)
- Debian/Ubuntu: Full support
- Other Linux: Limited support, may require manual steps
- FreeBSD: Limited support, requires manual configuration
- Windows: Not supported natively (use WSL)

### Security Considerations

- Some antivirus software may flag mining tools
- Running with minimum privileges is recommended
- Verify downloaded scripts before execution
- Do not run as root unless necessary

### Mining Performance

- Performance varies greatly by hardware
- Older CPUs may have poor mining efficiency
- Consider power costs versus potential earnings
- MoneroOcean pool auto-switches to most profitable algorithm

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service won't start**:

   - Check logs with `make status`
   - Ensure wallet address is valid
   - Verify permissions on executable: `chmod +x xmrig`

2. **Low hashrate**:

   - Enable MSR modifications if supported
   - Use huge pages if available
   - Adjust thread count to match your CPU

3. **Service restarts after stopping**:

   - Use `make service-disable` instead of just `make stop`
   - On macOS, unload the service: `launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.moneroocean.xmrig.plist`

4. **Build failures**:
   - Install missing dependencies
   - Ensure your system meets minimum requirements
   - Try manual build steps from XMRig documentation

### Default Log Locations

- macOS: `/Users/your_user/Monero-miner-setup/main/logs/`
- Linux: `/home/your_user/Monero-miner-setup/main/logs/`
